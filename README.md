# Koray Eren - T2A2 Marketplace Assignment - Game Away

## Mission / Problem Statement

The aim of this website is to connect people wanting to buy and sell second-hand video games.

## Why is this a problem that needs solving?

While this site's functionality is nothing ground-breaking, we aim to provide a less commercial environment for real people - not businesses - to connect and trade games, consoles, and accessories.

We're sick of having to sift through what feels like a million listings priced above recommended retail price to find genuine second-hand sellers on existing marketplaces.
